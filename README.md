# Cancer-detection-project
Cancer detection using CNN
This project was my first step into the field of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. It provided a great opportunity to gain hands-on experience in data uploading, processing, and modelingâ€”especially when working with unstructured data like images. Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and enhanced my teamwork skills.
